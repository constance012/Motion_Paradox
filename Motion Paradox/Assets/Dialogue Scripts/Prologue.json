Everyone at the TVB was freaking out when you suddenly disappeared after that screeching sound coming from our lab.","\n","^I'm still at the lab, you told me to go grab some materials for our new machine, when I was coming back there was a white flash coming from the lab, along with that screeching sound.","\n","^I rushed into the room to check on you, only to realized you were no where to be found. And the core of the machine was dropped on the floor.","\n","^Where are you, Doc? Tell me your location so I can give it to the rescue team, and they can escort you back safely.","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^Hm, so that was what happened. The core did become unstable because of certain parameters I entered, causing a rift in space and time.","\n","^The white flash was the result of the rift's rapid expansion, and after it shrank, it teleported everything that came into contact with it, and then-","\n","#","^speaker: pender","/#","#","^portrait: radio","/#","#","^layout: speaker_right","/#","^Come on, Doc!

Alright, I'm sorry. Okay, back to the question, I don't know how to describe this location to you all, honestly.","\n","^It's like a vast prairie filled with flowers and rocks, with no signs of civilians or human settlements.","\n","^And it's currently daytime now, but I don't see the sun or any visible light sources around here, so I have no idea how this place is even illuminated.","\n","^It looks like space and time here have been distorted in some inexplanable way, it feels really strange and unstable.","\n","#","^speaker: Pender","/#","#","^portrait: radio","/#","#","^layout: speaker_right","/#","^Wait, Doc, so you're telling me that you don't even know where you are now? Then how can we rescue you now?","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^That's the problem, kid. I think this is some kind of unstable dimension that we time travelers occasionally get stuck in.","\n","^Professor <b>Lewis</b> was the first to come up with the definition of \"Unstable Dimensions\".

Hello?","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^I'm here, kid. Let me ask this, did you stop mid sentence again? I couldn't hear your voice for a brief moment.","\n","#","^speaker: Pender","/#","#","^portrait: radio","/#","#","^layout: speaker_right","/#","^No, I didn't. What's wrong? Was the signal interfered again? This can't happen twice in a row, right? Especially since these radios of ours are newer models.","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^I highly doubt the problem is due to signal interference. It's more likely related to the \"time\" in this place.","\n","^It seems like time here only flows when I'm standing still, which explains why your voice is cut off every time I take a step.","\n","#","^speaker: Pender","/#","#","^portrait: radio","/#","#","^layout: speaker_right","/#","^What? How is that even possible, Doc? That doesn't make any sense to me.","\n","^Let say if that really is the case, wouldn't it create some kind of paradox? Like how can you even move while time itself isn't moving?","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^I don't know either, kid. They're called unstable dimensions for a reason, we can't just apply our regular knowledge and logic to these places, can we?","\n","^Now forget how it is even possible, we just need to acknowledge that such a thing exists in this place.","\n","^And most importantly, how do I get out of here alive?","\n","^Pender, can you please tell me again about that portal? I'll make sure not to move an inch so it doesn't happen again.","\n","#","^speaker: Pender","/#","#","^portrait: radio","/#","#","^layout: speaker_right","/#","^*Sign* This is the third time already Doc! But whatever.","\n","^So, as I was saying, again, this portal was personally modified by Professor Lewis and can now be used to help unlucky time travelers out tricky situations.","\n","^Wait, Doc, are you still listening?","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^I am, kid. Go on.","\n","#","^speaker: Pender","/#","#","^portrait: radio","/#","#","^layout: speaker_right","/#","^Okay great! So, Professor Lewis integrated a restoration module into the main control panel, which helps restore the integrity of time in unstable dimensions.","\n","^Now you just need to place the portal stand in a secure location, turn it on, select <b>\"Construct home portal\"</b>, and make sure to <b>check</b> the <b>\"Restore time integrity\"</b> check box.","\n","#","^speaker: Emit","/#","#","^portrait: dr_emit","/#","#","^layout: speaker_left","/#","^Hm, just as I suspected, the integrity of time is the main reason behind the strange phenomena and appearance of this place.","\n","^Okay, wait a moment, kid.
